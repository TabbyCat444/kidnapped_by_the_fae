# kidnapped_by_the_fae
One of the first things I ever programmed, done in conjunction with an intro to scripting course.

A simple text based game about being kiddnapped by the fae and trying to get home.

Story:
You stepped into a mushroom circle while strolling through the woods and now you have found yourself in the fairy kingdom. A small fairy kindly provides you with a few tips when you ask where you are and how to get home. You must find the Fairy King deep in the strange woods you have been transported too and plead your case to go back home. Do not go empty handed however, it is recommended that you first find a silver leaf, a river pebble, a small bone, an exotic mushroom, a pretty feather, and an opal. If you try to convince the Fairy King to release you without these gifts you will be stuck here forever.
